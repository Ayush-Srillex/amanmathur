                                    <p>Here's a page for random school for thoughts by me. I'm developing this page so you can directly add here if you want, but you know "dheeraj" doesn't give me time to do anything apart from office :/</p>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                        <h3>Here you go!</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            What follows from here is a mixed khichdi of thoughts, which require a mind clear of literaly everything, so read on only if you're free. You're a good friend of mine, and that's why I decided to write this, but feel free to not read any of it. I'm sorry I'm bad a giving a disclaimer, so just go with the flow, and read this like you're listening to a long rant by me.    
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We've been friends for some time now, right from DDF days continuing till today and ahead. Khoob saari calls, chats and video calls ensured that we stayed friends, even during this deadly pandemic, which still is a long way to being completely eliminated. We've shared secrets to one another with the trust one only places in a good friend. I would like to share one more secret of mine with the same trust. This is of a different kind because this involves you directly.
                                        </p>

											It might be too much to take in right now, becuase honestly I have never said it before, so I have no experience how to convey this. This started from somewhere around December, all the way till today. The reason was very simple- I liked talking to you.
                                            There are about 100-200 differences between you and me, and only about 1-2 similarity, but still I always used to look forward to talking to you whenever we had the chance. But there is a reason why I decided to say this now and not 9 months back.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have always debated with myself on how to go about it. Whether the feelings are real or transitory, what would you be thinking, how to tell this to you, what would happen if I were to convey this, and what would happen if I were not. After every discussion, I would come to same conclusion, I have to find some or the other way to convey this, otherwise it doesn't mean anything. Par main bohot hi pre technology type banda hun iss maamle mein.
										    <ol>
												One thing from my side was decided for sure, whatever happens, I will not convey this over a text or call or video call. I simply do not find this right to convey such things over Internet. I decided to wait till the pandemic gets over, make a trip to Shimla or wherever we could meet, and the convey- face to face. Whatever be the response, this way I get to experience live your reactions. But the pandemic never ended, infact it rose dangerously high in April-May.
												I never got to meet you because of all the travel restrictions
											</ol>
											<ol>
												2nd, in the rare scenario of actually getting the same response from your side, I had to consider how would things turn out in future, if things do happen. I was very sure that if this happens, I would put all my time and energy for this but still it would be very difficult for me to maintain things just over e-meetings and Internet. I cannot sustain simple friendships over internet, this is completely different. I like offline meetings, roaming around, talking face to face etc.
											</ol>
											Please note that all these discussions happened with myself only :p There were times when I almost failed and let go of these feelings to you, only to hold myself back because of the reasonings I had with me. But then, I have finally decided to tell this over Internet. Why so?
										</p>
										<p>
											The last video call we had, I realised something. By waiting to meet you face to face and conveying all this, I was a bit too late. But I still don't remorse over my decision to not convey to you before, because I would have messed up big time in future, something I didn't want you to suffer through. But I am telling this to you now, because I believe I'll never get another oppurtunity to meet you in a long time. You're a good friend of mine, so I feel comfortable in sharing my feelings, even if they don'e take me anywhere. Because you're a good friend, its easy for me to convey this.
										</p>
										<p>This was just a scribbled mix of feelings I could write. I am not a particulary goof writer and expresser, so this is the best I have. Looking forward to more video calls and hopefully meeting you soon!! jaldi mumbai aoo!!</p>
