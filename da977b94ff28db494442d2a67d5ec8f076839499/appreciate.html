                                    <p>Here’s a section to visit if you ever need a small amount of appreciation. You already know how me trying to motivate someone goes :P So here’s a small list, in a response to the beautiful list you sent me (for the record, I REALLY appreciate that Anime one you wrote, by god rona aa gaya)</p>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                        <h3>Here you go!</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><p>You are one of the most hardworking people I have met. And judging by some of them which you have shown me, your work emits quality. Never doubt your work! </p></li>
                                            <li><p>No one has the capability of bring you down. You are capable of achieving everything you wish for on your own. </p></li>
                                            <li><p>You are truly an exceptional artist. Be your hand embroidery, paintings, or dance, there are very less individual with multi talent portfolio. It reflects your beautiful and creativity mind.</p></li>
                                            <li><p>You are one of the sweetest people I know, but when the time comes, you are also straight up savage xD. Never change!</p></li>
                                            <li><p>5.	This is more of a suggestion rather than appreciation, that I think I have done as much I could have (its less but o, bear with it :p)- Its somehow related to the 4th point- Never change! Never change someone who you are, but at some point of time, you’ll have to change. So be readily acceptable to changes! Be open to changes, but don’t change the person you’ve become all the way here.</p></li>
                                           
                                        </ol>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>I went into a little bit of boring diplomatic mode, Sorry can’t help it looool. Ok Byeee!</p>
